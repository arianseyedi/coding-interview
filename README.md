# The Coding-Interview
  This repository is dedicated to efficient implimentation of interesting algorithms, much like the ones asked in phone/in person interviews. </br> Most questions are drawn from Laakmann McDowell, 2015. Implementations are all mine, I do not use the solutions, if I do, I will mention that in the documentation. Here I am not trying to duplicate other people's work for mine, nor am I copying something without wanting to mention where from. I simply love coding, and this is my way of practicing and also building a portfolio. You can leave your comments/suggestions for me, it will be greatly appreciated.
### This is a Java project
  * It is broken down into three parts (Java packages):
   1. Algorithms
   2. Data Structures
   3. Knowledge
